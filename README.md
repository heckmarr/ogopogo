This is the second iteration of my ill fated social app,
Ogopogo. This time it'll be a JSON based interpreter.

There will be a central server that sends and recieves
JSON input and output. Rust and Tui provide the front end.

It will be in essence, a text based game, but with modern
trimmings. Ie, not written in C. And different from my
usual projects in that it will not utilize GTK or QT.

I aim to have a test server up in the next week or so,
I will update this readme with connection info when that
time comes.
