This is the second iteration of my ill fated social app,
Ogopogo. This time it'll be a JSON based interpreter.

There will be a central server that sends and recieves
JSON input and output. Rust and Tui provide the front end.

It will be in essence, a text based social media experience
, but with modern trimmings. Ie, not written in C. And 
different from my usual projects in that it will not utilize GTK or QT.

I will update this readme with connection info when that
time comes.
